##Synchrony Project

Create a Spring Boot REST app that exposes endpoints to
• Register a User with basic information, username, and password

• Upload, view and delete images after authorizing the username/password.

• Associate the updated list of images with the user profile

• View the User Basic Information and the Images

Leverage the Imgur API i.e. the Spring Boot APP should integrate with Imgur API to upload, view and delete the images

##App Requirements

• Should use H2 (In-memory database) and JPA to store the user information with user name and password,
retrieve the user name and password to authenticate the user

• Integrate with imgur’s API to upload, view and delete images. No need to worry about albums or galleries

• Create only 1 account at Imgur for the app to integrate.

• No UI should be built. The requirements should be implemented using the REST API’s.


#Other Notes

• Use GitHub or Bitbucket for your project.

• Good coding practices (logging, comments, test cases, domain driven design, 3-layer architecture – Controller,
Service, Repository) are encouraged

• Use of 3rd party libraries are acceptable

• Any additional compile steps needed need to be documented in a README.md


#Bonus Points

• Secure API via oAuth2

• Optimize API for 100K RPM

• Establish CI/CD Pipeline (feel free to use open-source tools)

• Create a messaging event that publishes the username and the image name to a Messaging Platform (Ex: Kafka)
& feel free to connect with a local or cloud instance of the Messaging Platform
